# Exercism FSharp - Exercises with my Solutions

Just an archive of my solutions to the Exercism F# track. This the primary way I learned F#, over the course of a 114 occasionally very grueling exercises. An excellent learning tool :)

Also, in the root of this Repo, is a small console app called file-formatter. The exercism CLI command 'exercism r' will copy down all your solutions with their exercises, but seems to have a bug where it sticks blank lines between the source lines. 

This file formatter, which I wrote in F# shortly after finishing all the exercises, goes through the files and trims out these extra breaks. Bonus credit for me!
